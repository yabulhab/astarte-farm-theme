					<h4>our history</h4>	
					<p> Astarte Farm sits on 6.6 acres of rich Pioneer Valley loam located on the southwest side of the Hadley town common. In 1999, Dan Pratt, an experienced organic farmer, bought the land and began Astarte Farm. The farm became certified organic in 2003 and has been popular around the valley for its great tasting heirloom veggies. In May 2014, we purchased Astarte Farm and with Dan's help have begun growing our own organic fruits and vegetables. In 2014 we sold our produce at the Kendrick Park Farmers Market in Amherst, as well as All Things Local in Amherst and River Valley Market in Northampton.</p>
