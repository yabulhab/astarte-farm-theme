					<h4>A History of No-Till at  Astarte</h4>		
					<p>
						One of the first pieces of new equipment purchased for the farm in 2000 was
						a small Italian spading machine that was reputed to be a more gentle way to
						break ground. Somewhat similar to a rototiller, it operated at a much slower
						pace with small spade-like blades that broke up the soil without churning it.
						Semi-permanent production beds were established at the working width of
						the spader and mown grass paths alternated with them across the field. The
						grass paths were envisioned as refuge spots for a wide variety of soil life,
						from earthworms to microscopic fungal threads, in the hope that the benefits
						derived from those life forms would tend to bleed over into the production
						beds. While that was true to some extent, after ten years of use some
						problems became evident.
						<br><br>
						Despite years of cover cropping, compost applications and incorporating all
						crop residues into the soils, there was no overall increase in the soil organic
						matter. While the production beds would fluff up after spading into seemingly
						ideal soil for planting, after just a few hard rains the soil would become
						compact and settle below the level of the paths. In essence, the soils that
						were spaded were slowly shrinking, while the mowed paths were rising with
						every season that they were left undisturbed. The production beds were liable
						to crack on the surface after dry spells, and the absence of earthworms and
						beetles was a clear indicator that things were not going in the right direction.
						However, there were several positive signs that helped steer the farm toward
						no-till. Any crop that stayed in the ground longer than three months usually
						showed abundant earthworm activity around their roots. Crops that had
						sufficient organic mulch tended to leave the soil in a friable, soft condition.
						Any perennial crops with adequate mulch, as well as the mown grass paths
						showed frequent blooms of mushroom activity.
						<br><br>
						In 2013 at the summer NOFA conference, Dr. Elaine Ingham gave a one-day
						intensive on the soil food web. See www.soilfoodweb.com for complete
						information. It was an eye opening experience that brought many of the
						farm’s soil building failures into focus. A commitment was made to begin
						experimenting with no-till on the fall garlic planting. A very good crop was
						quickly followed with lettuce plantings in the same beds that also displayed
						superior growth, and the farm launched into a deeper commitment to no-till.
						<br><br>
						Rattan Lal of Ohio State University estimates that our earth’s agricultural soils
						have lost 50% to 70% of their original carbon stock, much of which has simply
						oxidized during the annual cycles of plowing, discing and weed elimination as
						practiced on the vast majority of farms worldwide. Most of that lost carbon
						has escaped into our atmosphere as CO 2 , a powerful greenhouse gas. Every
						disturbance of the soil has a damaging effect on the complex soil food web
						that has sustained life on this planet for eons. Think of how a forest can grow
						without any form of artificial fertilization, and think of the incredible growth of
						the individual trees accomplished with only the aid of fungi, bacteria, macro
						and micro soil life in conjunction with the minerals inherent in all soils.
						<br><br>
						Soils with abundant biological activity can reclaim some of that lost carbon
						and essentially act as carbon sinks. It has been noted by other researchers
						that plants with strong mycorrhizal soil-to-root connections can transfer up to
						15% more carbon to the soil than non-connected plants. Bolstering soil
						microbiology so that root or mycorrhizal fungi can thrive is the primary focus
						of our soil building efforts on Astarte Farm. Currently, we are in the process of
						creating various cropping systems that do not require any (or minimal) tillage
						and rely exclusively on compost for fertility. The crop goals of these systems
						are to achieve an increase in marketable yields, to encourage a decrease in
						disease and pest pressure, to establish a noticeable improvement in flavor or
						“terroir” in our produce and to allow lengthened storage times as well.
						<br><br>
						There are plenty more successes and failures to discuss concerning our first
						three year’s worth of work. When the no-till technques work, they work really,
						really well and often set the stage for following years’ successes. When they
						flop, or are poorly executed, it can indeed mean reduced yields. However,
						even those reduced yields may be offset in the long run by the vastly
						increased soil biological activity that these attempts create. It is so often the
						stuff we cannot see or hold in our hands that is so important in this world, and
						any way that we can devise to enhance the hidden work within our soils will
						be of benefit to the whole planet.

					<h4>our history</h4>	
					<p> Astarte Farm sits on 6.6 acres of rich Pioneer Valley loam located on the southwest side of the Hadley town common. In 1999, Dan Pratt, an experienced organic farmer, bought the land and began Astarte Farm. The farm became certified organic in 2003 and has been popular around the valley for its great tasting heirloom veggies. In May 2014, we purchased Astarte Farm and with Dan's help have begun growing our own organic fruits and vegetables. In 2014 we sold our produce at the Kendrick Park Farmers Market in Amherst, as well as All Things Local in Amherst and River Valley Market in Northampton.</p>
